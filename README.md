# Pokemon-Database

This is another side project that focuses on enhancing my ability to parse through a database and fetching the necessary information. 

This webstie focuses on the concept of a Pokedex where users can search up Pokemon with their name which will show what
the pokemon looks like, their type, as well as their abilities.
